Bibliography,OpenMinTeD,8647405,1,"Molecular mapping of <span class='openminted_taxon'>wheat</span>: major genes and rearrangements in homoeologous groups 4, 5, and 7. A molecular-marker linkage map of hexaploid <span class='openminted_taxon'>wheat</span> (<span class='openminted_taxon'>Triticum</span> aestivum L. em. Thell) provides a framework for integration with teh classical genetic map and a record of the chromosomal rearrangements involved in the evolution of this crop species. We have constructed restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) maps of the A-, B-, and D-genome chromosomes of homoeologous groups 4, 5, and 7 of <span class='openminted_taxon'>wheat</span> using 114 F7 lines from a synthetic X cultivated <span class='openminted_taxon'>wheat</span> cross and clones from 10 DNA libraries. Chromosomal breakpoints for known ancestral reciprocal translocations involving these chromosomes and for a known pericentric inversion on chromosome 4A were localized by linkage and aneuploid analysis. Known genes mapped include the major vernalization genes <span class='openminted_gene'>Vrn1</span> and <span class='openminted_gene'>Vrn3</span> on chromosome arms 5AL and 5DL, the red-coleoptile gene Rc1 on 7AS, and presumptively the leaf-rust (Puccinia recondita f.sp. tritici) resistance gene <span class='openminted_gene'>Lr34</span> on 7DS and the <span class='openminted_phenotype'>kernel-hardness</span> gene <span class='openminted_gene'>Ha</span> on 5DS. RFLP markers previously obtained for powdery-mildew (Blumeria graminis f.sp. tritici) resistance genes <span class='openminted_gene'>Pm2</span> and <span class='openminted_gene'>Pm1</span> were localized on chromosome arms 5DS and 7AL.
